                    <h2>Watch</h2>
                    <p>A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps or any other kind of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain.</p>

                    <h2>Bike</h2>
                    <p>A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, or cycle, is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle. Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.</p>

                    <h2>Car</h2>
                    <p>A car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one-to-eight people, have four wheels and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.</p>
